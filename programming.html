        <a href="http://cs50.harvard.edu"> <h2>CS50</h2> </a>
        <p> Anyone can take it. It is really fun and the quality of the lessons is great.</p>
        <p>
            I was 11th grade when I actually started CS50. But I gave up in the third or fourth week's problem set. I found it very hard to 
            complete. But I would get back to it after a few days or few weeks to try it out again. So after going with few giving-ups and getting-backs, I got into 12th grade. 
            Lots of responsibilty came down to my shoulders that is to show what I have learned from 12 years of studying. So I spent my time entirely on math and physics even though ,at night, I used to
            write code at the computer room of the dormitory until I sleep.  
        </p>
        <p>
            At last, I graduated happily with my classmates and friends in spring 2022. Very lovely times. And the last task of my 12 years of studying career came to our door. ЭЕШ.
            I got really good scores in my ЭЕШ but I could have got two 800s if I used my IELTS and SAT scores to match the ЭЕШ scores. I kinda regret that. But that is f okay.
        </p>
        <p>
            And after that, my new life begins, which depends solely on me. I had already set my mind to get through the programming as soon as possible after school life. And things went as planned.
            I moved in to my UB home. The first task was to finish CS50. And I got that done.
